# Lowerdash: array iteration methods for UnityScript

Lowerdash v0.1 by Mr Speaker (@mrspeaker)

Makes processing Arrays in Unity a bit nicer. Add Lowerdash.js to your `assests` directory to get access to the static methods. Here's an example:

    _.map(Array(1,2,3), function (el: int) {
        return el * 2;
    }; // [2, 4, 6]

See LowerdashTest.test() for more examples, and unit tests.
